feat: Implement initial structure for Module E: Strategy Lab

This commit establishes the foundational file structure and basic conductor logic
for the "Strategy Lab" module (Module E) according to the "Standard Module
Pattern" and "Conductor Module Pattern" defined in `Strategy_Lab_V2_Plan.md`.

Changes include:
- Created `public/js/modules/strategy-lab/` directory and its sub-modules
  (`sources`, `watched-list`, `paper-trades`) with placeholder files.
- Modified `public/js/app-main.js` to import and initialize the `strategy-lab` module.
- Modified `public/index.html` to include the Strategy Lab UI structure and sub-tab containers.
- Updated `docs/Strategy_Lab_V2_Plan.md` with a "Workflow Clarification for LLM Interaction" section.
- Updated `docs/CURRENT_TASK_LOG.md` to reflect the completion of the "Implement Initial Structure for Module E: Strategy Lab" task.
