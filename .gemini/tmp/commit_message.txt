feat: Improve server management and fix Strategy Lab sub-tab display

This commit introduces scripts for background server management and resolves
the issue of Strategy Lab sub-tabs not populating.

Changes include:
- Added `start-server-bg.ps1` to run the Node.js server in the background.
- Added `stop-server.ps1` to gracefully stop the background server process.
- Updated `package.json` with a `start-bg` script for convenient background server launch.
- Modified `public/css/main.css` to include display rules for `.sub-tab-content`,
  ensuring Strategy Lab sub-panels are correctly shown/hidden.
- Updated `docs/CURRENT_TASK_LOG.md` to reflect task progress.
