refactor: Remove background server management scripts

This commit removes the `start-server-bg.ps1`, `stop-server.ps1` scripts,
and the `server.pid` file, along with the `start-bg` script from `package.json`.
These scripts were introduced for background server management but proved
unreliable in the current execution environment.
