fix: Re-apply dynamic module initialization for main tabs

This commit re-applies the previously reverted JavaScript logic to correctly
initialize tab-specific modules after their HTML content is loaded into the DOM.

Changes include:
- Restoring modifications to `public/js/modules/navigation/index.js` to use
  dynamic `import()` and call `initializeModule()` after HTML injection.
- Restoring the removal of the premature `strategyLab.initializeModule()` call
  from `public/js/app-main.js`.
This resolves the "Strategy Lab container not found" error and ensures
correct sub-tab population.
