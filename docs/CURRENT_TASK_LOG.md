# Task: Fix Settings Modal Content

## Plan

1.  **[x]** Identify that `index.html` contains a placeholder settings modal, and the detailed content in `_settings.html` is not being used.
2.  **[x]** Read the content of `public/_settings.html` and `public/index.html`.
3.  **[x]** Replace the placeholder modal in `index.html` with the detailed modal content.
4.  **[x]** Delete the redundant `public/_settings.html` file.
5.  **[ ]** Commit the changes.
